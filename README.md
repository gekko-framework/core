# Gekko

## What is it?

Gekko is an experimental PHP framework to speed up the process of building web applications and tools, aiming to let the developer be the one in control of every aspect of the development process through the use of components that provide the specific level of abstraction required to get both functional and extensible tools, without limiting the developer.

## Is it production ready?

No. It is in an early development stage, and you need to expect breaking changes all the way down into the path of getting a V1.

## Where do I start?

Go to the [Gekko's skeleton project](https://github.com/gekko-framework/skel) for instructions to create your first application.

## Can I contribute to the project?

Yes, **Gekko** is open to the world to receive contributions.
